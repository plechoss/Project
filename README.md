# Title
### Film and tv series subtitles - evolution over time

# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

Movies and TV Series are an integral part of lives of people all over the world. The themes that they engage in often reflect the social issues of the given time. 

# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 

* Are films treating certain themes more likely to become box-office hits? 
* Can we see any periodically-recurring themes in the subittles?
* How is the availability of subtitles for the deaf or hard-of-hearing (SDH) changing over time?

# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

We're going to use the OpenSubtitles dataset and get the additional meta-data like the release date or box-office results from IMDB. We'll have to clean up the subtitle text files to contain words only and match the subtitles with the IMDB movie/tv series ids.
