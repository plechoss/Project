# Title
### Social issues in films and tv series and their reception

# Abstract
Movies and TV Series are an integral part of lives of people all over the world. The themes that they engage in often reflect the social issues of the given time. In many cases they are the deciding factor of the film/tv series' popularity instead of its artistic merit. Is it possible to see how well the movie/tv series will be received based on its core themes? How big is the 'market' for movies/tv series tackling these social issues, compared to other topics? One of the social issues treated could be e.x. the Catholic church scandals in the previous years. We'll try to answer this question and others using the OpenSubtitles and IMDB databases.

# Research questions
* Are films/tv series that treat certain themes more likely to become box-office hits?
* Can we see any periodically-recurring themes in the subtitles?
* Are films/tv series that 'simpler' words and expressions more likely to be popular?
* Are certain names associated more with leading characters?
* How much influence does the film's location have on its success?

# Dataset
We're going to use the OpenSubtitles dataset and get the additional meta-data like the release date or box-office results from IMDB. Additionally we'll need the Words API for language statistics.  We'll have to filter out punctuation and stop words from the subtitle XML files and match them with the IMDB movie/tv series ids.

Datasets:
* OpenSubtitles
* IMDB API
* Datamuse API
