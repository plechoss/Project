# Title
### Film and tv series subtitles - evolution over time

# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

Movies and TV Series are an integral part of lives of people all over the world. The themes that they engage in often reflect the social issues of the given time. In many cases they are the deciding factor of the film/tv series' popularity instead of its artistic merit. Is it possible to see how well the movie/tv series will be received based on its core themes? We'll try to answer this question using the OpenSubtitles and IMDB databases.

# Research questions
* Are films/tv series that treat certain themes more likely to become box-office hits? 
* Can we see any periodically-recurring themes in the subittles?
* Are films/tv series that 'simpler' words and expressions more likely to be popular?
* How is the availability of subtitles for the deaf or hard-of-hearing (SDH) changing over time?

# Dataset
We're going to use the OpenSubtitles dataset and get the additional meta-data like the release date or box-office results from IMDB. Additionally we'll need the Words API for language statistics.  We'll have to clean up the subtitle text files to contain words only and match the subtitles with the IMDB movie/tv series ids.

Datasets:
* OpenSubtitles
* IMDB API
* Words API
